    "# Exploiting a Lending Protocol via Oracle Manipulation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will play the role of a DeFi attacker exploiting a vulnerable lending protocol on the **Sepolia testnet**. The target is a simple lending contract that relies on a **price oracle** from a decentralized exchange. By manipulating the oracle's price feed, you'll trick the protocol into letting you drain its funds. Students pull off the exploit and win the \"jackpot\" one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Setup assumptions:** You have an Ethereum wallet (MetaMask or similar) connected to Sepolia and some test **Sepolia ETH** for gas in your wallet.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Vulnerable Lending Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "**Protocol Overview:** The lending contract allows users to **deposit PEARL tokens as collateral** and **borrow HUSD stablecoins** against that collateral. It determines the collateral’s value using a **price oracle** – in this case, the *current exchange rate from a PEARL/HUSD decentralized exchange pair*. There is no administrator setting the price; the contract simply trusts the DEX’s spot price. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it's vulnerable:** Using a live DEX price directly is dangerous because an attacker can **manipulate the price** with trades. The contract doesn’t use any time-weighted average or external oracle – it just reads the instantaneous pool ratio. This means a sudden buy or sell on the PEARL/HUSD pool can wildly skew the reported price. An attacker can pump the PEARL price to absurd levels *within one transaction*, tricking the lending contract into thinking the collateral is worth far more HUSD than it actually is. As one security analysis notes, protocols that naively use a liquidity pool’s spot price as their oracle are *“almost 100%” guaranteed to get rekt by a flash loan or price manipulation attack* ([The Full Guide to Price Oracle Manipulation Attacks](https://www.cyfrin.io/blog/price-oracle-manipulation-attacks-with-examples#:~:text=All%20these%20questions%20fit%20critically,with%20a%20larger%20market%20cap)).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Contract behavior:** When you call the lending contract’s borrow function, it roughly does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Checks your collateral value:** It queries the PEARL/HUSD pair for reserves to compute the price of PEARL. For example, if the pair has `(reservePEARL, reserveHUSD)`, the price of 1 PEARL (in HUSD) might be calculated as `price = reserveHUSD / reservePEARL`. Then `collateralValue = yourPEARLBalance * price`. (No sanity checks or time averaging are applied.)\n",
    "- **Ensures sufficient collateral:** If your collateral value (in HUSD) is *at least* the amount of HUSD you want to borrow, it proceeds. (For simplicity, assume a 1:1 collateral ratio requirement – no extra margin – making the exploit even easier.)\n",
    "- **Transfers HUSD to you:** If the check passes, the contract transfers the requested HUSD from its pool to your address, as a loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the core logic of the lending protocol: (Note that, for simplicity, we have removed some parts of the code that are only for the purpose of the lab. Only the admin can use those parts, you don't need to worry about them. However, you can see the full code on Etherscan.)\n",

    "**Key vulnerability:** The `getPearlPrice()` function simply uses the DEX reserve ratio as the price. If you can drastically lower `reservePEARL` relative to `reserveHUSD` (by buying up PEARL from the pool), the calculated price skyrockets. The contract will think your collateral is worth a fortune in HUSD, allowing you to borrow the **entire HUSD pool** with a minimal amount of PEARL deposited. There are no oracles like Chainlink or time-weighted average prices (TWAP) to prevent this – it’s entirely trusting the manipulable spot price ([The Full Guide to Price Oracle Manipulation Attacks](https://www.cyfrin.io/blog/price-oracle-manipulation-attacks-with-examples#:~:text=,downside%20is%20that%20they%20are)).\n",

    "## Exploit Strategy Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "To exploit this lending protocol, the high-level strategy is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Acquire PEARL cheaply, then inflate its price.** Use HUSD to buy a large amount of PEARL from the PEARL/HUSD pool. This trade will remove PEARL from the pool and put in HUSD, causing the pool price of PEARL to shoot up (because now **each PEARL is backed by more HUSD in the pool**). This swap is done by taking a flashloan of HUSD, so, you don't need to own any HUSD beforehand.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Borrow HUSD against overpriced PEARL collateral.** With the price now artificially high, even a small PEARL deposit is valued extremely high by the lending contract. You call the borrow function to take as much HUSD as possible. The goal is to **drain the HUSD pool** (the “jackpot”). Since the contract thinks your collateral is ample, it will give you all its HUSD.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. (Optional for profit realism) You could swap back the PEARL for HUSD after borrowing, to return the price to normal and pocket the difference. However, in this simplified competition, you don’t actually need to do this to succeed – draining the pool is enough to win the round.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why a contract?** While you could attempt the steps manually (buy PEARL on a DEX, then call borrow), using a **custom exploit contract** has advantages:\n",
    "- It lets you sequence actions within one transaction or script, making the exploit faster and more automated (important if racing other attackers).\n",
    "- You can use flashloans (a flashloan needs to be borrowed and paid back in the same transaction) and perform the attack without owning a lot of tokens beforehand.\n",
    "- It can hold tokens and interact with multiple contracts (DEX and lending) in one place.\n",
    "- You can easily reuse the exploit code for each attempt by just deploying a new instance (if your first address gets blocked).\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Compile the exploit contract:** You can use Remix (browser Solidity IDE) to compile the `Exploiter` contract. In Remix, paste the Solidity code (with your filled sections).\n",

    "3. **Deploy the contract:** Deploy `Exploiter` to **Sepolia**. Use your wallet (connected to Sepolia) and be ready to confirm the transaction and pay a small amount of test ETH for gas. After deploying, note the **address of your exploit contract**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Execute the attack (call `exploit()` with flashAmount=1000000000000000000000000000):** In Remix, with the deployed exploit contract selected, call the `exploit()` function. This will trigger your contract to:\n",

    "   - repay the flash loan and keep the remaining HUSD as profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Confirm the transaction. If your exploit succeeds, this single transaction will drain the lending pool’s HUSD into your contract!\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Observe the outcome:** After running `exploit()`:\n",
    "   - Check the **HUSD balance** of your exploit contract. It should have increased by the amount drained from the lending pool (minus the HUSD flashloan amount you paid back). Essentially, this is your “stolen” amount.\n",
    "   - The lending contract should have **blocked your address** (the exploit contract’s address) from further borrowing. If you try to call `borrow` again (or deposit more and borrow), it should revert with \"blocked\". This ensures you can’t win twice.\n",
    "   - The instructor (the process is automated!) will now **refill the lending pool** for the next round and bring the Uniswap pool price back to normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip:** If you encounter any issues (for example, the swap not pulling out as much PEARL as expected, or running out of gas), double-check:\n",
    "   - Your contract is borrowing enough HUSD.\n",
    "   - Approval is set correctly.\n",
    "   - That you used the correct parameter order for the swap.\n",

    "- **Refill:** The available HUSD liquidity to borrow gets refilled in the lending contract. Now a second student can perform the same exploit. The second exploiter’s address will then be blocked as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Subsequent rounds:** The pattern continues till all the students have exploited the contract. \n",

    "*⚠️ Note:* All the exploits are happening on a public test network. Be mindful that anyone with the contract address and know-how could attempt the exploit. In a classroom setting, this is fine (and part of the fun), but remember on real networks this kind of vulnerability is catastrophic. Real attackers bundle steps into a single atomic transaction (often with flash loans) to ensure they cannot be outpaced or the price returns to normal before they act.\n",

    "## Challenge: Defending Against Oracle Manipulation\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ve seen how trivial it is to exploit a lending protocol that uses an **insecure price oracle**. **Why was this attack possible, and how could the protocol have been designed to prevent it?** Consider and discuss the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Oracle Design:** What if the protocol used a more reliable price feed instead of a raw DEX price? For example, **Chainlink** or another decentralized oracle network provides aggregated price data that is **significantly harder to manipulate** (an attacker would need to corrupt a majority of oracles ([The Full Guide to Price Oracle Manipulation Attacks](https://www.cyfrin.io/blog/price-oracle-manipulation-attacks-with-examples#:~:text=loans.%20,nodes%20on%20a%20price%20feed))】. How would using such an oracle help here?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Price Averaging:** DEXes like Uniswap v2/v3 offer a **Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP)** oracle. This means the price is averaged over a window of time, making rapid swings (like those from flash trades) much less effective. Flash loan attacks usually manipulate price within one block, but a TWAP would **smooth out the price**, making the oracle **resistant to instantaneous manipulation* ([The Full Guide to Price Oracle Manipulation Attacks](https://www.cyfrin.io/blog/price-oracle-manipulation-attacks-with-examples#:~:text=,lagging%20indicator%20of%20price%20values))】. What are the trade-offs of using a TWAP (consider price latency vs. safety)?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Collateral and Liquidity Safeguards:** How might the lending protocol itself limit damage? Think about adding **collateralization ratios** (requiring more collateral than the value of the loan), **borrow limits**, or **circuit breakers** that pause borrowing if prices move too fast. Could requiring multiple price sources or a delay before using a new price update help?\n",
    "\n",
    "Reflect on how real-world lending platforms (Compound, Aave, etc.) implement protections. By understanding these defenses, you’ll appreciate what goes into designing secure DeFi protocols and why oracle choice is critical. **Discuss your ideas** in your submission – this is an open-ended challenge with multiple valid approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Congratulations** on completing the exploit lab! You’ve learned how oracle manipulation attacks can wreak havoc on insecure DeFi contracts. This hands-on experience should also underscore the importance of robust oracle mechanisms in any lending protocol. Now that you’ve seen how to break the system, think about how to build it stronger.
