    "- Transfer and sale of NFTs \n",
    "- Explore and understand the functionality of the ERC721 Standard.\n",
    "- Explore an existing collection's contract and locate off-chain metadata (IPFS).\n",
    "- View an on-chain interactive NFT collection and locate the programmatic metadata generation within its contract.\n",

    "# Prerequisites \n",
    "\n",
    "- Metamask \n",
    "- Ensure a minimum of 0.2 SepoliaETH in your account\n",

    "# Register an ENS\n",
    "\n",
    "Ethereum Name Service is a decentralized domain name service that runs on the Ethereum blockchain; it maps a human-readable name to an Ethereum address (EOA or a contract). It improves usability since ENS is well integrated within wallets - making it easier to transfer funds to your friends or interact with known contracts. In this part of the lab, you will set up an ENS name for one of your wallets on Sepolia. Please follow the steps below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Go to the ENS web app at https://sepolia.app.ens.domains/\n",
    "- Type in a preferred name and pick it if available - Note that the name will be available in public, so choose a pseudonymous name so that your wallet address cannot be linked back to your real name.\n",
    "- Start the timer - the timer ensures that there is no front-running attack on ENS\n",
    "- Register the name after the wait\n",
    "\n",
    "How does the timer mechanism prevent front running? Hint: The address who submits the commit and the reveal first gets the name, and there should be a minimum 1-minute gap between the commit and reveal\n",

    "# Exploring an ERC721 NFT collection\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will be taking a deep dive into an ERC 721 contract and understanding how an NFT is stored. We will looking at an NFT collection called [Doodles](https://opensea.io/collection/doodles-official); their contract can be found at [https://etherscan.io/address/0x8a90cab2b38dba80c64b7734e58ee1db38b8992e#code](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8a90cab2b38dba80c64b7734e58ee1db38b8992e#code). Please follow the steps below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visit this contract, specifically looking at `Doodles.sol` and `ERC721.sol`.\n",
    "- Specifically, note and understand the connection between the `setBaseURI` method in `Doodles.sol` and the `tokenURI` method in `ERC721.sol`, which is what allows the storage of a URI for each token's metadata.\n",
    "- Access the read contract tab, and call the Token URI method on a token id of your choice other than `1`.\n",
    "- Example output for token id `1`: `ipfs://QmPMc4tcBsMqLRuCQtPmPe84bpSjrC3Ky7t3JWuHXYB4aS/1`\n",
    "- This is the IPFS URI where the token's metadata is stored (off-chain). To access this link within your browser, you will generate a URL using Cloudflare's IPFS gateway. To do so, replace `ipfs://` with `https://ipfs.com/ipfs/` for your token URI.\n",
